## What is the Developer Advocate Manifesto
This is a living document that sets of guidelines for developers commited to advocating for their fellow dev.

## Origin
There are many wonderful developer advocates that are working on behalf of their companies to build amazing communities. 

Shouldn't developers be committed to helping one another to achieve successs as much as possible?

> but the real goal of a Developer Advocate is to become the voice of the user. - Ashley McNamara "[What Is Developer Advocacy](https://medium.com/@ashleymcnamara/what-is-developer-advocacy-3a92442b627c)"

This is an document created hoping to identify allies in the growth of ALL developers willing to pass it forward. 

## The Manifesto
The Manifesto (as currently defined in [Manifesto.md](https://github.com/kjaymiller/Developer-Advocate-Manifesto/blob/master/Manifesto.md))

* The value of the Developer is more important than the code they write or the company they write for.
* The Developer should be valued and respected regardless of seniority, experience, or popularity.
* Although disagreements in practice may come, It is my responsibility to address differences with empathy and compassion with the desire to learn, teach, and grow.
* The things we build should not be used to discriminate or disadvantage others. I commit to creating ethical code and am willing to contribute it towards the success of others both in and out of development industry.

It is my mission to help my fellow Developer in the growth of their knowledge and opportunity. I recognize the path to and through a Developer's career can be challenging and I agree to support them how I am able, wether at the beginning, middle, or end of that journey.
